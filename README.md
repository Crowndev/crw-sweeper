Crown Sweeper v0.1.0 beta
=========================

This tool is designed to facilitate sweeping masternode and systemnode
rewards. It can also be used any time you want to exercise control over
which "coins" are used in a particular send operation. 

## Background
Over time node rewards, especially for operators of multiple nodes, can
accumulate in numbers so large that even using coin control in the GUI
wallet it is not trivial to consolidate them. The sweeper can be run
when using either daemon or GUI wallet and provides hybrid functionality
between coin control and the "spendfrom" command line tool.

## Requirements
The packaged executable has some minimum requirements. If your machine does
not meet them you could instead try running the tool from source with your
already installed Python interpreter (so long as it is at least version 3.6).

Platform | Minimum version
---|---
linux | Ubuntu 16.04 or equivalent
Windows | Windows 10
MacOS | 10.15

## Installation
- Download the artifact for your platform.
- unzip it using your preferred unzip utility. 
**Note** that Github artifacts download as dynamically created zip
files. Unfortunately this **strips the execute permission bit from 
linux/OSX executables**. After unzipping the artifact you must manually
restore the execute permission by:

    ```chmod +x dist/CrownSweeper```
- move or copy the executable to your preferred location.

## Post Installation
Crown Sweeper makes an RPC connection to a running Crown wallet. If you 
normally only run the GUI wallet (crown-qt) you will need to update your
config file (crown.conf) to include RPC server configuration directives
so that the sweeper can connect. The config file is located in the data 
directory, the default locations are:

Platform | Default location
---|---
linux | $HOME/.crown
Windows | c:\users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\Crown
MacOS | no idea

If you can connect to the wallet using crown-cli then it is already 
configured. Otherwise edit or create the file and add the following
directives:
```
rpcuser=<anything you like>
rpcpassword=<something hard to guess>
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
server=1
```
After changing the crown.conf you must restart the wallet.

## Operation
Upon execution a window is displayed showing all the wallet addresses
containing unlocked Unspent Transaction Outputs ( 
[UTXOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output) 
), the total amount of CRW in each address, the label/account attached
to each address and the number of UTXOs in each. 

![Sweeper](img/screenshot.png)

One or more addresses may be selected by clicking on them. The sum
available in those addresses is displayed and entered by default in the
"Amount" box. The amount can be overridden if the user chooses. The "To"
address can be entered manually, a new address in the same wallet
generated automatically, or one of the from addresses can be copied as
the destination. 

The "Upto" checkbox serves two functions:
* It indicates that fees are included in the sent amount (ie: the
received amount will be smaller than shown by at least the fees amount)
* It indicates that a transaction should be generated even if the total
value of the available UTXOs which will fit within the transaction size
limit is less than the required amount.

If "Upto" is not checked then the fee is additional to the amount to
send, and the value in the selected addresses must be greater than the
sum of amount and fee. Any change will be sent to the last listed from
address.  

The fee defaults to 0.025 CRW. You may choose a smaller or larger (upto
1% of the transaction value) amount.

After selecting the inputs and setting the receiving address, amount and
fee, hit "Sweep" and the transaction will be generated. If successfully
broadcast the transaction id will be displayed and the UTXO list
refreshed. If the generate/broadcast fails the reason why will be shown
instead.

Transactions are limited in size to 250KB (about 1600 UTXOs) and in
value up to the available funds. You may need to perform more than one
sweep if the amount to send cannot be accommodated in a single
transaction.

## Gotchas
Pyinstaller creates an executable which contains **most** of what is 
required to run the program. On linux especially there are still some
dependencies on the underlying operating system (eg: C runtime, fonts,
D-BUS). You may encounter "noise" or actual error messages when running
Crown Sweeper. Typical noise messages are from fontconfig and can be
ignored. You might end up with ugly fonts but the tool should work.

If you get a message like
```
** (CrownSweeper:5928): WARNING **: 16:41:54.023: Couldn't register with ccessibility bus: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.
```
you can safely ignore it. Alternatively you can completely mute it by
setting an environment variable 

   ```export NO_AT_BRIDGE=1```

If you get a message like
```
[31589] Error loading Python lib '/tmp/_MEIt7CYkQ/libpython3.7m.so.1.0': dlopen: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.25' not found (required by /tmp/_MEIt7CYkQ/libpython3.7m.so.1.0)
```
your C runtime is too old. Try running from source instead or consider
upgrading your distro.

tool found in the Crown/contrib (derived from Bitcoin/contrib) directory.
